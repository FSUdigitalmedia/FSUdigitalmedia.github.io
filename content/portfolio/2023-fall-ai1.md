#### Critical Design, Speculative Design, and "User (un-)friendliness"

In this project, students were challenged to create an interactive artwork/experience that involves the user in an activity of looking
critically at technology and their relationship to it. The user interface is the site of the critique. 

Examples of relevant topics that we discussed and read about in class, in both
Hertzian Tales and Speculative Everything (Dunne & Raby), include:

* Focusing on "user-friendliness" as a means to mask underlying political ideology, and bringing that
ideology to the surface for scrutiny
* Challenging notions of effiency and speed as the primary objectives of user interfaces
* Imagining alternative-presents and future possibilities, with respect to our relationships to technology, that challenge the current status quo of design/technology
* Using speculative design methodologies (eg: reductio ad absurdum, speculative fiction, counterfactuals, etc) to achieve the above creating a user interface that contrasts ideas of user-friendliness, by focusing on poetic interactions, inviting the user to complete the construction of meaning, or taking advantage of other ideas from critical design such as defamiliarization, functional estrangement, etc.

Tools used: p5.js, git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

#### Games

In this project, students created artwork using the medium of videogames. 
Discussions centered around readings from Rise of the Video Game Zinesters (Anthropy) and How to Do Things with Videogames (Bogost). Students were encouraged, when appropriate to the concept of the game, to consider ways
of interacting with the game that go beyond the default interfaces of keyboard/mouse/gamepad/monitor. 
The idea for the artwork must take advantage of the unique opportunities that the medium of videogames
afford for both the artist and the audience.
